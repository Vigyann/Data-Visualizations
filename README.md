## Types of Plots and Visualizations

This repository includes a variety of plots and visualizations, each serving unique analytical purposes:

1. **Geographical Area Maps** (using Folium):  
   - Create interactive maps with markers, choropleth layers, and location-based visualizations.
   
2. **Heatmaps**:  
   - Represent data density or intensity using colors to show relationships in a matrix format.

3. **Radar Charts**:  
   - Display multi-dimensional data with a radial layout, commonly used for performance comparisons.

4. **Catplots**:  
   - Combine categorical data with multiple visualizations like bar, box, or scatter plots.

5. **Scatter Plots**:  
   - Visualize relationships between two numerical variables to identify patterns or correlations.

6. **Bar Charts and Stacked Bar Charts**:  
   - Represent categorical data or proportions with vertical or horizontal bars.

7. **Line Plots**:  
   - Highlight trends and changes over time in continuous data.

8. **Boxplots**:  
   - Summarize data distributions with quartiles and outliers in a compact form.

9. **Violin Plots**:  
   - Combine boxplots with kernel density plots to show data distribution and variability.

10. **Area Plots**:  
    - Depict trends over time by stacking data as filled areas under curves.

11. **Swarmplots**:  
    - Distribute data points across categories while avoiding overlap, ideal for detailed distributions.

12. **Moving Averages**:  
    - Smooth data trends over time, useful for time-series analysis.

13. **Pie Charts**:  
    - Display proportions or percentages of a whole using circular charts.

14. **Histograms**:  
    - Visualize the distribution of numerical data across intervals.
