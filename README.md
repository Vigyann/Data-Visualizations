Visualizations using Matplotlib, Folium, Seaborn in Python

Matplotlib: A versatile Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Used for basic plots like line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms. Great for detailed customization and low-level control.

Seaborn: Built on Matplotlib, it simplifies statistical plotting with beautiful, theme-based charts. Used for advanced visualizations like heatmaps, violin plots, pair plots, and regression plots, especially with Pandas dataframes.

Folium: Used for creating interactive maps. Ideal for geospatial data visualization, such as plotting points, heatmaps, and choropleth maps on geographical locations .
